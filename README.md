# School-Projects
*A set of projects done over the course of my education, and improved versions!*

## Introduction
This repo contains most of the SWE based projects I've done over the course of my educational career in many languages, from C, to C++, Java, Python, etc. My goal in publishing these projects is both provide a reminder of how far my skills have developed as a programmer, and to give me an opportunity to improve on those projects. 

## Repo Structure
I've structured the repo into folders for each project. Folders contain their own README describing the project, and the changes I made to each going along. 

## Styling Standards
Part of this project is to become familiar with the styling standards that work for me and practice using them. For C projects (which should be the majority of these repos), I'll be trying to follow the clang-format guidelines outlined in [this lovely repo by MaJerle](https://github.com/MaJerle/c-code-style). However, all my projects will be following JavaDoc style block comments where applicable. The assumption is that my documentation is generated through Doxygen, which allows for this style of block comment in most circumstances.
